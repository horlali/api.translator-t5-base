# FastAPI application for T5-Base Model

## Dev Toolchain

* [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management
* [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code styling
* [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting styling
* [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) for linting

In the `scripts/` folder there are 3 scripts that can be used to check and correct any
problems. The scripts will only check by default, if you would
like to correct the errors you need to pass the `--fix` option. If you are using `zsh`
and got some errors, consider execution via `bash`

## Setup Locally

```bash
cd src/
poetry install
poetry shell
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Running tests

In the root of the repository `:~/api.translator-t5-base$` run the scripts below

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

## Running linters

In the root of the repository `:~/api.translator-t5-base$` run the scripts below

```bash
./scripts/black-check.sh # add --fix flag to fix black linting issues
./scripts/flake8-check.sh
./scripts/isort-check.sh
```

## Running all linters and test cases in one line

In the root of the repository `:~/api.translator-t5-base$` run the scripts below

```bash
./scripts/all-checks.sh
```

## Sample Request

Once the application is up and running (see how on main [README](../README.md)), make a simple request with the command below

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://0.0.0.0:8000/api/v1/translate/ \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "source_language": "English",
  "destination_language": "French",
  "text": "How are you?"
}'
```

## Expected Response

```bash
"Comment vous Ãªtes-vous?"
```
